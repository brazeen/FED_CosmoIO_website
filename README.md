## Overview
Oh no!
I'm Cosmo the astronaut, and I find myself stranded on the moon with my trusty spaceship but not enough fuel to make it back home. The good news? Our spaceship runs on knowledge, and that's where **you** come in!

Embark on an out-of-this-world journey to help me get back to Earth by answering trivia questions across various topics. Whether it's testing your mathematical prowess, challenging your musical ear, or delving into general knowledge, your answers will fuel our spaceship's knowledge engines.

How to Play:

Choose your preferred difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Based on your selection, the fuel level will decrease accordingly to each wrong answer.
Face questions from math, music, and general knowledge categories.
Correct answers maintain our fuel gauge, propelling us closer to home, while wrong answers will decrease the fuel gauge, leaving us with a lesser chance of getting back!
The more questions you answer correctly, the closer we get to a safe return!
Compete with other players to reach the highest fuel percentage left when you reach Earth and top the leaderboards with your knowledge skills!
Assemble your trivia knowledge and let's soar through the stars together. Get ready for an astronomical adventure that combines learning and fun. Are you ready to help Cosmo make it back to Earth?

Let the cosmic quest begin! ðŸŒŒâœ¨
