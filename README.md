Oh no!
I'm Cosmo the astronaut, and I find myself stranded on the moon with my trusty spaceship but not enough fuel to make it back home. The good news? Our spaceship runs on knowledge, and that's where **you** come in!

Embark on an out-of-this-world journey to help me get back to Earth by answering trivia questions across various topics. Whether it's testing your mathematical prowess, challenging your musical ear, or delving into general knowledge, your answers will fuel our spaceship's knowledge engines.

How to Play:

Choose your preferred difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Based on your selection, the fuel level will decrease accordingly to each wrong answer.
Face questions from math, music, and general knowledge categories.
Correct answers maintain our fuel gauge, propelling us closer to home, while wrong answers will decrease the fuel gauge, leaving us with a lesser chance of getting back!
The more questions you answer correctly, the closer we get to a safe return!
Compete with other players to reach the highest fuel percentage left when you reach Earth and top the leaderboards with your knowledge skills!
Assemble your trivia knowledge and let's soar through the stars together. Get ready for an astronomical adventure that combines learning and fun. Are you ready to help Cosmo make it back to Earth?

Let the cosmic quest begin! ðŸŒŒâœ¨

## Design Process
For parts the design of this website, we decided to use a 3D JavaScript library called three.js to add planets and stars in a 3-dimensional space. The first thing that comes to mind when people think of space is a vast, never-ending void, so we 
made sure to make it feel like that by adding 3D elements (which also add to the user experience with user interactions using mouse movement), as we felt a 2D space environment might not have had the same effect. In addition, we used fonts that
we felt aligned with the space theme of the website, incorporating Sci-Fi fonts like Orbitron into our website to complete the feel. Space itself is a dark place, 
and hence we stuck to an overall darker theme and colour scheme for the website as having too many bright elements would take away from the environment and feeling of space we wanted to portray.

User stories:
As a curious and avid learner, I want to explore a gamified trivia experience, so that I can learn new facts and trivia, while also doing it in a fun, entertaining and unique way.

As a player interested in mathematics, I want to face math-related trivia questions, so that I can apply and test my mathematical knowledge, while doing it in a fun way instead of the usual textbook questions.

As a music lover, I want to test myself with music-related trivia questions, so that I can enjoy challenges related to my passion and test my musical knowledge.

As a general knowledge buff, I want to answer questions covering a variety of topics, so that I can showcase my broad knowledge and learn new facts.

As a competitive game player, I want to see how little fuel I can use to get back to Earth compared to other players, and keep setting new high scores.

As a user navigating the website, I want clear instructions on how to play the game, so that I can easily understand the rules and objectives of the cosmic quest.

As a user seeking a fun and immersive experience, I want to experience the website's engaging visuals and animations, so that I can enjoy a visually appealing journey as I play, while also getting the chance to learn new facts.

From general users to competitive players, this site will give everyone a fun, challenging and enjoyable experience to learn new facts and improve their knowledge.
